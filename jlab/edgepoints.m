%EDGEPOINTS  Exclude edge effect regions from ridge or modmax points. 
%  
%   EDGEPOINTS is used to remove edge-effect regions from a set of
%   wavelet ridge points or wavelet modulus maxima points.
%
%   INDEX=EDGEPOINTS(X,II,JJ,L) where X is a column vector containing
%   a data series, II and JJ are respectively indices into the
%   time-location and scale-location of certain points of the wavelet
%   tranform of X, returns an index INDEX such that the points
%   II(INDEX), JJ(INDEX) lie outside the edge-effect region.
%  
%   The edge effect region is determined as follows.  L is an array of
%   the same length as the number of frequency bands used in the
%   wavelet transform.  At the Nth frequency band, L(N) gives the
%   number of points from the edge of the time series which is taken
%   to be contaminated by edge effects.  L may also be a scalar.
%
%   The edges of the time series are taken to be the first and the
%   last non-NAN points of X.
%
%   INDEX=EDGEPOINTS(X,II,JJ,KK,L) where X a matrix containing
%   multiple data components in its columns, and KK is the index into
%   the data component number of the wavelet transform points, returns
%   INDEX such that points II(INDEX), JJ(INDEX), KK(INDEX) lie outside
%   the edge-effect regions of the respective data component.
%
%   Usage: index=edgepoints(x,ii,jj,L);
%          index=edgepoints(x,ii,jj,kk,L);
