This directory contains MATLAB code that enables the user to label arbitrary hydrographic data with neutral density (function gamma_n), and subsequently find the positions of specified neutral density surfaces on a section of hydrographic data (function nsfcs). The calling sequences for these two functions are given below. Complete details of the algorithms used in the package can be found in 'A neutral density variable for the world's oceans' by D.R. Jackett and T.J. McDougall, Journal of Physical Oceanography, Vol.27(2) 1997, 237-263. 

These two MATLAB functions respectively call two executable FORTRAN programs 'glabel_m' and 'nsfcs_m', which have been pre-compiled for use on a PC running Linux. Pre-compiled code also exists on the internet for a PC running Windows. If you wish to run this MATLAB code on a machine other than a PC you will need to copy down the FORTRAN/MATLAB version of the code from the internet, compile it and follow the instructions contained therein. 

To successfully run the code you will need to add the current directory to your MATLAB path variable.

The neutral_surface code does, on occasions, detect the existence of more than one solution (sns,tns,pns) for particular input neutral surfaces. In this case, the code returns with sns, tns and pns values corresponding to the middle crossing, and dsns, dtns and dpns values giving the possible error in this crossing. Also the file 'ns_multiples.dat' is written in the matlab_linux directory, containing all relevant information on the multiply defined surfaces. Specifically, for each cast in the section for which a surface is not uniquely defined, the file contains a line containing the triple (cast #, surface #, ncr = # crossings) and then ncr lines containing the (sns,tns,pns) solutions. This situation arises when the user's data is statically unstable. When such a problem cast comes from a section of data with well defined surfaces on neighbouring casts, the 'ns_multiples.dat' file can be inspected to make a choice of the most appropriate crossing.

We have also provided an M-file, 'example.m' in the directory ../test, which demonstrates the use of the two MATLAB functions on a three cast section of data. The output from running this example is contained in 'example.out'.
