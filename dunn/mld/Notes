	Notes for MLD analysis 
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(taking up at where Melissa Tipping finished working on my original work).

In Dec 97 produced MLD estimates from OBSERVED LEVEL WOA94 casts. 
Melissa used gethydobs to redo this analysis with WOA98 data.


31-May-99
~~~~~~~~~
New work ideas after reading Melissa.rpt (which she called "read_me"):

 - recalc with WOD98

 - perform residual screening on mapping (or was it done previously?)

 - use data to 450 or 500m, since some MLs go a bit beyond 400m.

 - examine magnitude of seasonal harmonics after mapping as a diagnostic
   or bad data or mapping

 - do correlations with nutrient as well as MLD maps 

 - do time-lagged correlations

 - refine bathy treatment by giving a NaN in regions where a certain 
   percentage of casts are mixed to bottom, or any casts are and the
   bottom depth is less than some value. This would prevent over-shoaling
   on MLDs in shelf waters.

 - ensure that min Q are used in mappings, as best available methods
   are used (could use BARS, Bogus, bathyweight etc). Varsort WAS used.

7-July-99
~~~~~~~~~
End of reworking analysis for the CZCS correlation presentation. MLD map
still very poor, especially with huge blobs in mean and seasonal magnitudes
in the south. This is of course due to very poor data distribution, but
especially where shallow seasonal MLs are very difficult to discern in deep
"permanent" almost isothermal & isohaline layers. Fine tuning thresholds can
cause estimates to jump between 40 and 400m!

Progress by:
  - using fine thresholds to capture real MLs rather than stale iso-property
    layers
  - use min of dSigma/dz, delT, delS  (but care with dSigma/dz because it often
    detects at the very top (10m) of the profile.
  - map with long lengthscales and maybe with something like seasonal subsample
    mean-only maps, to get smooth and robust mean fields. Use these either to
    to map seasonal cycles as anomalies, or use to screen prior to normal
    loess mapping. 
  - rely on screening to reject bad estimates [latest screening selected ONLY
    too-deep casts. Maybe that is fair, or maybe we need to look again at the
    curly issue of percentile screening, especially in multi-nodal areas like
    the EAC.]
  - manually thin surveys which result in anomolously high spatial & temporal
    data densities [eg where mean density over a large region is low, then a
    survey with sampling every 1/4 degree may be too dense. Such a case occurs
    at around 50S 140E.] Maybe auto-declustering could be tuned to address this
    especially in actual date rather than day-of-year is used.
  - discontinuities in NQ arise from some sort of problem in varsort!    
  - coastal/shelf data could be completely excluded from oceanic mapping, as
    it not only shrinks length scales but also tilts mapping planes causing
    overshoot in data voids.
  - do not interp high res casts to 2m. (on tests this had extremely minimal
    impact, so don't proceed with this.)
 
8-July-99
~~~~~~~~~
Refined MLD definitions in mixld.m.
Reworked all DPG (incl very latest) and WOD98 casts.
 
New mapping:
  - map with q1=500, q2=100.
  - use only data where bottom > 100m (and only map such areas). (mapA)
  - decluster and map (mapB) [this made negligible difference]

NOTE: Should be a major effect if go to using full-res WOD98 instead of 
      thinned data!!
  - using modified gethydobs.m (called gethires.m) called by woa_drive,
    create mld files for each WMO, then collate these with comb_woa.m to
    generate wod_hres.mat.

  - do same for normal obs files

  - compare the casts in both datasets (using the CPNs to match).

  - replace low-res MLDs with the hi-res counterparts (NOTE that of the 8790
    hi-res MLDs, 1497 were absent from the lo-res dataset, because the low-res
    had lost the necessary detail to distinguish the ML.)
    Saved to file new_woa_tot.mat.

  *** Had not yet dup-checked between CSIRO and WOD98! Achieve this for the
      MLDs using woa_dpg_dupchk.m.

  - DPG and WOD (less DPG-duplicates) saved to file comb_mlds.mat

  - map again with >100 m data (mapC)

  - without first declustering, crudely thin manually defined clusters 
    (arbitrarily skip every second one in cluster)  (mapD)

 ? - decluster & remap
 ? - screen & remap 

Maps above were still poor. Detailed examination of data in region SW of
Tassie should how this was due to
   - multi-modality in MLD estimates due to different mixing processes (so
     that in one survey the estimates can flick between 20m and 300m)
   - pathological data distributions

12-July-99
~~~~~~~~~~
Try to extend length scales to get a less structured result in data-poor
areas by thinning data in rich (coastal) areas which otherwise act as limits
to radius lengthening. Do this by taking bin means of data (and their doy's
and locations) on a fine spatial and temporal grid, using reduce_dat.m.
This could be regarded as another form of declustering or as super-ob-ing.

  - initially try .1 degree and monthly bins. 

  - could do this first with larger spatial bins and using Time instead of
    DOY, to increase independance of data (ie reduce impact of individual
    cruises). 

13-July-99
~~~~~~~~~~
Tried combinations of thinning, screening & reduc_dat (the above binning
method). Final version had manual thinning, bdep>120m, screening @ 3 SD 
residuals, reduc_dat using .2 degree bins, 10 temporal bins. This was 
smoother and had lower and less structured temporal cycles, but still 
was clearly dominated by the problems of ambiguous and variable ML estimation,
one-sided screening (great majority of rejections were winter/deep), and 
pathological distributions.

Final version called  mld_jul13_map.mat.   

6-Aug-99
~~~~~~~~
Repeat above mapping, but using newly debugged varsort. Load jul13_mlds
and feed directly to mld_chunks using q1=500 q2=100 rmin=50 rmax=1250
xmarg=2450 ymarg=1450 minlev=6 (xw=1.5 in loess_rq_b). The difference is
utterly minimal.


Convert czcs (from czcs_fit) into czcs2mg [called output"pig"].

Calc corrm and corrn (using no3(2)), and save to corrs.mat

9-Aug-99
~~~~~~~~
Realise now need to retrieve shallow water MLD values and mapping. This means
reworking comb_mlds, rather than directly using jul13_mlds.

12-Aug-99
~~~~~~~~~
Still unhappy with MLD map. Used reduc_dat to super-ob min(mlds([1 2],:)) 
[that is, min of delT & delS MLDS] to .5-degree/monthly 
bin averages. Plotting 'markerplot' maps of this for summer and winter 
reinforced the belief that in the south there is a strong & simple seasonal
cycle throughout a broad zonal & meridional range, the main spatial trend 
being that summer MLDs remain slightly higher at higher lats. Can't think
how can impose this on loess, but found that got improved map just by using 
the same mapping config but using the super-obs as the sole data (did not need
to otherwise thin, screen, or exclude shallow regions.) 

This then is FINAL product (mld_aug12_map.mat and comb_mlds_sup_ob.mat).

18-Aug-99
~~~~~~~~~
Did NO3 mapping using semi-annual as well as annual harmonics (to be compatible
with all other datasets used). This was dubious because of scarcity of data,
and clearly had large unrealistic structures in semi-annual coeffs, esp in
SW. Onthe whole, seasonal cycle amps were increased throughout, but much of
it may have been plausible. Decided that the SW region does not matter for
this study (no CZCS to correlate with there anyway). Large regions, such as
central Tasman, where correlation fields significantly changed (esp towards
zero correlation). Examined 25S, 155-169E. Confirmed that the seasonal cycle
DID agree with (sparse) available data, and anyway, maybe a zero corrlation
is a more reasonable result than a strong +ve or -ve which arises from the 
slight bowing up or down from tiny annual harmonics forced onto data
which really doesn't display a clear annual sinusoid.

Redoing correlation plots.

 hh = colorbar('horiz');

Recent work done in /home/oez5/eez_data/mld/

Calc MLDs for all BOA, initially so could exclude ML from T/S mapping.
For this purpose, chose lower T threshold of .2C, to be more conservative.
Really, should have gone to old threshold of .04?

Have calc'ed MLD direct from CARS2005 
   ->  $hea/mlds_cars05a.mat 

See plots via cars2005.html. Note that these are not actually very useful.

9/5/06 Bronte asked for MLD maps of Tasman, using del Sigma of .06. Reran
MLD calcs on all BOA to include this criterion { mlds(:,5) } and mapped 
just using general/loess.m (both monthly and semi-an fitted)

   ->  $hea/mld_may06.mat

AT SOME STAGE I should do proper mapping of entire domain (for each mld and 
for MLD), and using proper technology (chunks, BAR & declustering at least).
