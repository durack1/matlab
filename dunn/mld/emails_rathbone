Jeff, Ken,
Can either of you point me to any gridded MLD fields covering the southern ocean in our region to 60 Degs South? The CARS data cuts out at approx 50 south so not quite far enough. Climatology would do but actual time data for 1998-2000 would be better.
cheers

Hi Chris

see /home/eez_data/atlas/mld_south.mat - it spans 45S-60S, 90-190E. This isfrom
all historical data. By "actual time data for 1998-2000" presumably you mean MLD
derived just for any CTD casts in that time period, not mapped fields? I could
provide you with those values, if it is of use, but certainly not enough data in
that period to attempt to map it.

Jeff,
Thanks, that will be useful. I assume that where it overlaps with 
/home/eez_data/atlas/mld_nov00 it is the same, because I will need to 
merge it with that.

I need mapped fields at present. Maybe sometime later that individual cast
 data would be useful. It might have good enough coverage near the SAZ 
sediment trap site?

By the way, can you tell me how you derived mld from the ctd data? I thought
there was some contention about the best way to do that.

cheers
Chris

Sorry - the two versions were done at different times so they may not overlap
perfectly - you might have to fudge a fade from one to the other.

Yes- it might be adequate there.

There is not "some contention" - there is backstabbing and open abuse! It is
 a very vague thing to measure and it really depends on what you mean by MLD. I
generally take high resolution CTD, interpolate to 2m depths, take nearest T
 and S values to 10m as reference "surface" values, find depths at which the 
profiles
first differ from the "surface" values by .4C or .03 psu, and use the shallower
of the 2 depths. Sometimes I also use a density criterion, but .. arrrk I have
to go...

More tomorrow

Hi Chris

Just to finish the brief description of the MLD fields:

with MLD, how the data is mapped is as important as how MLd is defined 
for each cast, because MLD values have a weird distribution. Eg the ML 
may be 20-40m for weeks, then a storm causes mixing down to 500m. Another
 storm might soon mix to 150m while the water is still nearly mixed down 
to 500m from the earlier one.
All very messy, and a simple average is not very appropriate. However, the
mapped fields ARE based around simple averaging. To anyone who says it is 
wrong I can only say "of course it is - so why did you ask for maps of MLD!"
One way to slightly improve it might be to have 2 fields: "mean non-storm MLD"
 and "mean storm MLD", OR "most common MLD" and "max MLD range". These are 
not easy to define and map (with the extremely sparse data we have, given 
also that we'd need to resolve seasonal cycles of these parameters), but 
I'll have to give it a go sometime.

Chris - if you see that a particular treatment is more sensible for your
application then let me know - I may in the future be able to tailor a 
product to that purpose.

Jeff

Jeff,
thanks for your detailed and interesting reply.
For primary productivity what is needed is probably even more complex - the depth to which particles have recently (week -month??) been in the 0-20 m photic zone!! However the error in the MLD is unlikely to be the greatest uncertainty in the productivity calculation so anything will do in the meantime.
