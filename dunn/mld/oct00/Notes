Reworking for productivity paper.

Using only original WOD98 & CSIRO MLD estimates (which span 90-190E,
55S-5N?), use mld_drive.m to remap to [90 180 -50 0] to extend analysis
from 100E to 90E. Note that this is not a good mapping in the extended area
because no data to the west of mapping, but is much easier than 
regenerating the whole dataset.

Just done CARS2000 NO3 maps, but do a special one for 10m depth, so that
have semi-annual harmonics to improve seasonal cycle comparison. This 
extra map also done from 90E, and with rmax expanded for 2300km to prevent
bad structure in SW data-void.

Rerun CZCS/getcol.m (fit=1, ie using /home/eez_data/czcs/seas_fit_czcs.nc 
rather than /home/eez_data/czcs/av_month_czcs.nc) to expand this field
to 90E.

Tried correlation-region map with colour blending through gaps between 
regions (reg_map_fancy.m), but decided best just to grey-fill these gaps.

Just refining plots.

More on plots. Refined numberred_regions plot with stippling to show low
seasonal cycle regions, using ranges from vrng.mat, and
stipple(x,y,no3_vrng,0,.25,1,'-',.5,2,'color',[.3 .3 .3])
stipple(x,y,mld_vrng,0,12,1,'-',.5,1,'color',[.5 .2 .2])
