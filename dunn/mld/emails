Hi Jason

Thanks for the feedback. The discontinuity at 47S is because at that
point we switch over to a form of projection (Gravest Empirical Mode -
GEM) which is more successful in southern waters. Soo - it is not
pretty, but is a side effect of trying to get best results, on average.
My tendency would be to leave the discontinuity in the MLD fields, out
of honesty and a reminder of what sort of product we a dealing with.

synTS is not at all optimal for hindcasting profile shape - hence MLD.
It is derived from mean T,S at each depth, and perturbed by
T,H(0)->T(z),S(z) relations, so the vertical structure is sort of
incidental and if anything can be predicted about it - you would guess
it would be smeared! That said, when using Tz-T0 and Sz-S0 MLD tests
then, because it does a reasonable job of relating T and S to SST, one
could expect it to have some skill. It will enormously underestimate
variability of MLD, and I expect tend to overestimate MLD (because
smallscale structure is lost.)  Anyway, I would not say "do not use it"
- it is plausible that it can provide some small amount of skill - and
if you can convince yourself of that then I'm all for it!  If someone
comes along with an EOF or other vertical-structure-based projection
method [which we would like to do oneday] then certainly assess that
product, because in theory it should be better for MLD. The best option
should eventually be model nowcasts.

I've cc'ed this to Ken so he can tell you how much of the above is total
garbage!

Cheers
  Jeff

Sorry to keep bugging you with questions, but I think I've found
something that may be of interest to you.
 
I was looking at the results implementing the method that you used in
determining the CARS MLD and came across some curious results in an area
south of NZ.  I looked further at the temperature profiles in that area,
and got some results where the profile changes dramatically from one box
to the other around 47S.
 
I've attached some maps of the temp at depth for the region that is
causing problems.
 
My questions....
 
 
Are you aware of this?
Is it correct?
How does one handle the resulting MLD which also has deep MLD on on side
of the "knife edge" and shallow on the other?
 
And a related question.  Is synTS an appropriate product for calculating
a MLD for the australasian region?  Apart from some of these glithces,
it appears to be giving pretty good results.

Jeff,
  no worries on the delayed response. Thanks for the clarification and
yes it does make sense that the values are such based on the methods
use.  I think for our purposes we'll set the values to zero for now and
mask out those that are relatively too shallow.  Thanks again.

- Dirk

Hi Dirk

Sorry - I didn't get to work on Friday.

The -ve values in the mean field in mld_cars05a.nc all arise where the
mapping 
has had to extrapolate inshore of any real observations. In these cases
the 
shorewards-shoaling of MLD has extrapolated to a -ve value, which is of
course 
not physically correct. (It could be argued that no form of
extrapolation should 
be used, but there are always trade-offs and counter-examples for each
method - 
just have to keep in mind that mapping is always an approximation.)

Anyway, the first concern would be that unrealistic values like this
indicate 
that something is grossly wrong. I believe this is not the case, and
that these 
places are where very shallow ML commonly occur. Whether you replace
these with 
0 or some small value must depend on what is most useful and appropriate
to your 
application. (I guess another angle on splitting hairs about shallow ML
is that 
this analysis is based on CTD data. The "sea surface" value of a CTD
cast is 
actually taken from the bottom of the CTD which is stationed "just belwo
the 
surface", so is somewhere between 2 and 5m depth, depending on seastate
and the 
care of the operator!)  

Hope this makes sense and is useful

 Cheers
   Jeff
