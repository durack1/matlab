(frm email to Bronte, May 06)

I am reminded that, although you can map this stuff in minutes I have spent 
weeks on it in the past, so although the circa 2000 version used much less data 
it was a pretty well groomed product. The problem is that mapping usually 
assumes data variance is guassian, or at least some sort of central 
distribution. On the other hand, MLD is in many places bi-modal or multi-modal - 
in the south you can get MLDs of 10m and 400m a few days apart in the same spot. 
The upshot is that unless you have an extremely good data distribution in space 
and time (we never do) then the maps will show lots of ugly looking structure. 
The cheat is to crank up lengthscales so that it all gets smeared out, and to 
hell with any real features. Part of what I did previously was some careful 
"super-ob-ing" - pre-averaging - to absorb the high-frequencies, prior to 
mapping. Anyway, I can't put the energy into doing that just now, so I present 2 
versions:  the c2000 MLD fields (which you have already) with nutrients at the 
monthly MLDs, and the same for my best shot for now of mapping new data. 
(It is pretty interesting to calc MLD directly from CARS T and S mean fields, 
but not very useful - another story...)

Fitted harmonics cause large seasonal overshoots (and even large -ve means)
in some locations (esp Nth Atlantic). Much truer to data if cap mean
at a small postive value (2m?) and leave the seasonal overshoot for the 
user to cap. If suppress -ve seasonal values using season_nonneg, the
resulting curve is a poorer fit to the data which in most cases has a
season of flat near-zero MLD and a sharp seasonal peak of high values.
